Introducing, Polytimosâ€¦ The project built by anyone, for anyone. 

Have you ever felt left out of the Bitcoin movement? Here's your chance to not be. Polytimos has taken all of the best and most fundamental parts of Bitcoin and launched them in a time where many more people are familiar with crypto-currencies and their potential, with a location where people are already looking for new project launches.

This will allow Polytimos to adopt true decentralization, by having more people in the beginning who are aware of the project. More miners in a more diversified collective finding the project near launch, and mining the coins all over the globe.

More nodes to come all over the globe sooner, to last longer, and create an extremely large and solid worldwide network that can be used by anyone, for any purpose they deem worthy.
